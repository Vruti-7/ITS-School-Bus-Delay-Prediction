# 🚌 Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS) - Enhancing School Bus Breakdown & Delay Predictions  

🚀 **Project Overview:**  
This project leverages **machine learning** to predict **school bus breakdowns & delays**.  
Using **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models**, we aim to enhance **transportation reliability** with predictive analytics.  

📊 **Dataset:**  
- **Data Source:**  
  - [data.world](https://data.world/city-of-ny/ez4e-fazm)  
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthobau/busbreakdownanddelays/data)  
- **Dataset Name:** `Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays.csv`  
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, feature selection, SMOTE balancing.  

## ✨ Key Features  
✔️ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** 🔍  
✔️ **SMOTE for Handling Class Imbalance** ⚖️  
✔️ **Decision Tree, Random Forest & XGBoost Models** 🤖  
✔️ **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves)** 📈  
✔️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations** 🎨  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python 🐍** – Data processing & machine learning  
- **Jupyter Notebooks 📓** – Interactive analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy 📊** – Data manipulation
